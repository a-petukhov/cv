          <h2>Hello.</h2>
          <p>I am a newbie Web Developer. Before I decided to become a developer, I worked as a digital marketer for over 10 years. I believe that my previous experience will help me become a highly proffecient Web developer as each commercial web product must always include both correct business logic and sustainable technical compound.</p>

            <h3>Web Development</h3>
            <p>I have been a fan of new internet technologies since I got my first mobile phone in 2000. At that time, the WAP internet showed me the endless possibilities of new ways to consume information and communicate that actively penetrated our lives. Over the years, my interest in internet technologies only grew stronger. And so, six months earlier, I've decided to finally become not only their user but a part of its creators' community as a web developer.
              To become a true professional, I'm actively developing my knowledge and skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, Git, and Databases.</p>

            <h3>Digital Marketing</h3>
            <p>Even before I decided to become a Web Developer, my career was already tightly tethered to Internet Technologies. As a marketing manager, my central role was to grow various online businesses by attracting as many customers efficiently using monthly budgets with constant control over the ROMI. Over the ten years of my marketing career, I've successfully operated millions of marketing budgets that always brought more. I built my main areas of experience in business development via affiliate program management, online media buying, and marketing efforts consolidation through small and medium marketing teams management.</p>
